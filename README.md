# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate â€“ Labs and Final Projects

This repository contains all the hands-on labs and final projects completed as part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate program.

The materials are organized into two main sections:

- `learning-labs/`: Contains all the practical exercises and coding labs completed during each module. These labs cover core topics such as machine learning, deep learning with Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch, neural networks, and generative AI techniques.
  
- `final-projects/`: Includes the final projects for each module, showcasing applied knowledge and practical implementations using real-world datasets and problem-solving strategies.

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific course or topic within the specialization. This structure aims to demonstrate both foundational understanding and applied AI skills in various domains.
